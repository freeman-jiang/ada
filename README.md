# CS-401: Emotions as the Secret Architects of Cinema

This is my group's data story for the final project of [CS-401: Applied Data Analysis](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/applied-data-analysis-CS-401) held at the [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/) in Switzerland, earning a perfect grade.

We analyze extracted emotions in movie plots within the CMU Movie Summary Corpus.

If you are interested in the data analysis, it is at [github.com/epfl-ada/ada-2024-project-phpjj1](https://github.com/epfl-ada/ada-2024-project-phpjj1).

Built with Next.js, Tailwind, and MDX.
