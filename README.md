### [ada.freemanjiang.com](https://ada.freemanjiang.com/)

This is my group's datastory for the final project of [CS-401: Applied Data Analysis](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/applied-data-analysis-CS-401) held at the [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/) in Switzerland, earning a perfect grade.

We analyze extracted emotions in movie plots within the CMU Movie Summary Corpus.

Built with Next.js, Tailwind, and MDX.
